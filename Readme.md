# Backend Part

Backend is made using FastAPI. 
I use Hacker News API to collect the data to show in the UI like Story - 
    - Title
    - Author Name
    - Score
    - Time

Hacker News API for Top Stories - https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json

Backend is deployed in Render.

Backend URL of Top 10 Stories - https://hacker-news-topstories-backend.onrender.com/top-stories (Kindly using any JSON Formatter)
